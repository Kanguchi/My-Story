Once upon a time a hare and a tortoise had a race. The hare wanted to win very badly so he rushed ahead, and just to make fun of the tortoise, took a nap. The Tortoise went slow and steady and eventually caught up to the sleeping hare. The Tortoise ended up winning the race. Horray! Slow and steady wins the race.
